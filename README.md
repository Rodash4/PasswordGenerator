# PasswordGenerator

## My Task

This week's Challenge required me to modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It's clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.


## User Story

```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
